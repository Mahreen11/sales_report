# Sales Report
This is a report developed using powerBI. This report gives an overview of the sales made by a hardware company in different regions. It calculates the total revenue generated and total number of items sold. Also values for revenue and total items sold can be found for a particular year. A side bar graph shows revenue by region. And another side bar graph shows the sales quantity in each market. There are also 2 other charts that shows top 5 customers and top 5 products by revenue. 

PowerBI is an extremely useful tool to show such insights. PowerBI enables to apply filters and also these figures shifts and shows number according to the selection over the dashboard. For example, if I select a year from the dashboard the values will change, revenue and items sold will be calculated according to that year.
